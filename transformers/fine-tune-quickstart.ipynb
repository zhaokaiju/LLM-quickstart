I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

We call housekeeping for towels and after telling us it'd be ten minutes it turned out to be an hour and fifteen minutes. \\n\\nSince we didn't have our original room with two queen beds and a roller bed I ended up sleeping with a friend on one roller bed and 4 girls in the King Bed. \\n\\nWe still made the most of it but that was a seriously shitty inconvenience and they didn't even apologize for their mistake which made it even worse.</td>\n",

A true whino's bar that has a karaoke following with the younger generation of hipsters and wannabe indy-mod-sters alike.

Unfortunately unless you are a karaoke celebrity there really isn't a musical theme to be had.  I can dig a shitty bar if it plays punk rock or an old bar if it is vintage themed.  One thing that I can't do is enjoy a cold drink if I am not certain whether I will be raising glasses to Engelbert Humperdink, Slipknot or The Eagles [shudder] next.\\n\\nAlas' there is a strong following for this sacred bar and I will not over throw the fact that it is a decent place to meet with friends before adventuring on down either to the north to Freemont street or south to the strip.</td>\n",
